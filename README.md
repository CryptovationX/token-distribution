## Overview

Investment Robo-Advisory that uses quantitative analysis to recommend you the most profitable with low risk trading opportunities in cryptocurrencies.

## CryptovationX

The CXO Token `CryptovationX.sol` is ERC-20 standard compatible and has the following additional characteristics:

1. An initial amount of 900,000,000 CXO tokens supply.
2. An ability to burn tokens by users to reduce total number of token supply.

## Implementation

We use [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org) code for `SafeMath`, `Ownable`, `Burnable` and `StandardToken` logic.

* `SafeMath` provides arithmetic functions that throw exceptions when integer overflow occurs.
* `Ownable` keeps track of a contract owner and permits the transfer of ownership by the current owner.
* `Burnable` provides a burn function that decrements the balance of the burner and the total supply.
* `StandardToken` provides an implementation of the ERC-20 standard.

The token contract includes the following constants:

```javascript
    name             = "CryptovationX";
    symbol           = "CXO";
    decimals         = 18;
    INITIAL_SUPPLY   = 900 million CXO
```

The above constants indicate a maximum supply of 900 million tokens.
